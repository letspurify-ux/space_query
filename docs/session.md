# Database Session Lifecycle

This document covers execution, cancellation, timeouts, lazy fetch, and the
resulting physical-session decision. The transaction, residue, and lock model
belongs to [Retained sessions](transaction.md).

## Core rule

The logical connection selected by a query tab is separate from the physical
driver session. Cancellation or timeout may discard the physical session while
leaving the logical connection intact. A later execution acquires another pool
session for the same connection profile and generation.

A physical session is reused only after safety is established. Connectivity
alone does not prove that its transaction or session state is clean.

## Operation identity and stale events

At cancellation time, `SqlEditorWidget::cancel_target_snapshot()` creates a
`CancelTargetSnapshot` containing:

- Tab and editor IDs
- Operation ID
- Connection generation
- Database type and `SqlKind`
- `ExecutionState`, `LazyFetchState`, and auto-commit

Completion uses `ExecutionFinishedEvent` with the same identity. If the
operation ID or connection generation no longer matches, the policy returns
`SessionDecision::IgnoreStaleEvent`. An old worker must never overwrite a newer
operation or connection.

## States and requests

`ExecutionState` distinguishes idle, statement/script execution,
lazy-fetch-only, cancellation/closing, and unknown states. `LazyFetchState`
models this lifecycle:

```text
None -> Waiting <-> Fetching -> CloseRequested/CancelRequested -> Closed
```

UI-level `LazyFetchRequest` and worker-level `LazyFetchCommand` are separate.

| UI request | Worker behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `More` | `FetchMore(batch_size)` |
| `All` | `FetchAll` |
| `Cancel` | Graceful close or fetch cancellation, preserving reuse eligibility |
| `CancelAndDiscard` | Cancellation with physical-session discard intent |

Worker commands separately represent `GracefulClose`, `CancelFetch`, and
`ForceCancel`. A waiting cursor must be closed before reuse. A fetching cursor
requires both fetch-worker termination and cursor closure.

## Interruption classification

The UI execution path distinguishes these `InterruptKind` values:

- `Cancelled`
- `RecoverableTimeout`
- `NonRecoverableTimeout`
- `ConnectionError`
- `UnsafeOrUnknown`

`is_recoverable_timeout()` requires select-like SQL, a known lazy-fetch state,
and a database-specific driver marker. A generic timeout message synthesized by
the application is not enough. MySQL/MariaDB lock-wait timeout is a separate
transaction case and is not treated as a normal recoverable query timeout.

## Post-interruption decisions

`decide_session_after_interrupt()` maps `InterruptDecisionContext` to a
`SessionDecision`.

| Decision | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `IgnoreStaleEvent` | Ignore completion unrelated to the current operation |
| `ReuseSamePhysicalSession` | Keep the same session after cleanup and health check |
| `ReplacePhysicalSessionKeepUiConnected` | Discard physical session, keep logical connection |
| `RequireCommitOrRollback` | Retain session for transaction resolution |
| `RequirePhysicalSessionResolution` | Require residue/lock cleanup or discard |
| `MarkDirtyAndBlockNextExecution` | Block on an uncertain transaction-control result |

Normal reuse requires every applicable condition below:

- Snapshot operation and generation still match.
- The worker has ended and no connection-fatal error occurred.
- SQL classification and statement effects permit reuse.
- Lazy cursor and fetch worker cleanup are confirmed for the current state.
- A timeout is recoverable and temporary timeout settings were restored.
- Both the ping and `SELECT 1` in `health_check_session()` succeed.

DDL, session control, unsafe DML/PLSQL/script, and unknown SQL do not use this
normal reuse path. Existing retained state takes precedence over replacement.

## Database-specific cancellation

- OCI Oracle calls `break_execution()` on `Arc<Connection>` and closes with
  `CloseMode::Drop` on forced termination.
- Thin Oracle calls `OracleThinCancelHandle::break_execution()` and uses
  `force_close()` on forced termination.
- MySQL/MariaDB uses `KILL QUERY` through a separate control connection/context,
  followed by `KILL CONNECTION` for forced termination.
- A pool acquisition may be cancelled before a physical session exists. The
  operation snapshot still rejects late events in that case.

Driver-specific cleanup is reduced to a shared `SessionDecision`, and
`apply_session_decision()` updates the editor's retained and replace-pending
state.

## Next execution and scope

A reusable retained lease must match connection generation, pool-context epoch,
database type, and current schema/database. Oracle current schema and
MySQL/MariaDB current database are reapplied to new sessions. A running worker
is not mutated during a scope change; the scope takes effect at the next safe
acquisition or reuse point.

## Verification

```sh
cargo test session_policy --lib
cargo test lazy_fetch --lib
cargo test cancel --lib
cargo test --test concurrency_multithread_guards
cargo test --test db_dispatch_guards
```

A new cancellation path needs tests for stale operation, stale generation,
waiting/fetching cleanup, connection-fatal errors, timeout restoration failure,
and dirty retained state.
